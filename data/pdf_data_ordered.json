Creators should be aware that\nPublic Disclosure may result in loss of IP protection rights. This is especially true of Inventions as a\npatent is difficult or impossible to obtain if Public Disclosure of the Invention has occurred.\u00a0 Care must\ntherefore be taken to avoid premature disclosure before a patent application has been filed. In light of\nthis, Creators are strongly encouraged to make all reasonable efforts to identify any protectable IP as\nearly as possible and consult the ARIO before making any Public Disclosure of IP\n.\n"

Any Applied\nResearch Services Agreement must contain confidentiality clauses, and any College employees and\nstudents must be made aware of such confidentiality provisions to ensure that they are respected.\nPersons engaged in research shall treat as confidential all information received in the context of\nresearch activities that is designated as confidential by the party disclosing it or protected by a\nconfidentiality clause. This is especially important in the context of an Invention that could be patented,\nsince a patent cannot be obtained if there has been public disclosure of the Invention. \u00a0Note: Canada, the\nUnited States, Australia and several Latin American countries provide a twelve (12) month grace period\nafter the public disclosure first occurred to file a patent application, but a competitor could file a patent\non the disclosed Invention in that time period as well.\nTCPEs may require individuals within the College community to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as\nadditional protection, often prior to the College and the TCPE entering into an Applied Research Services\nAgreement. In such case, unless the NDA contains clauses that cannot be considered standard, the\nindividual shall be required to sign the NDA as a condition of participating in the project to indicate their\nacknowledgement of the NDA terms.\nFinally, where the AROI believes that Intellectual Property belonging to the College, or which the College\nlicenses from a third party, may be divulged during research activities, the College will request the TCPE\nto sign a non-disclosure agreement.\u00a0 As a matter of practice however, the NDA which the TCPE is asking\nthe College to sign may offer the parties mutual protection.\n4.4\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Use of Proper Binding Agreement\nRegardless of the Commercialization Pathway ultimately chosen Applied Research Services Agreements\nthat could result in the creation of new Intellectual Property must be documented in a written contract\nwhich:\u00a0\n1. protects the interests of the College, faculty and staff, and students, for example by minimizing the\npotential for, and the consequences of, a breach of the agreement and saves it harmless from\nfuture IP-related claims\n2. retains rights for the College to use the IP for educational and research purposes\nIn all instances, the contract shall explicitly or implicitly provide that the decision to commercialize\nArising IP will rest with the TCPE.\n"

        "text": "2. Application\nThis policy applies to all faculty, staff and all full-time and part-time (prospective, confirmed and\nregistered) students of the College from the time of application to a course or program through to\ncompletion of the course or graduation from the program, where these activities or actions are a\ncomponent of the relationship between the student and the institution.\u00a0\nThe information contained within this document applies to all students registered in any Loyalist course\nor any program offered by the College, in any location or in any format. At times, the individual\ncircumstances of a particular campus or a particular program may require a minor variation in procedure.\nThese will be communicated to students at the commencement of the program or particular course.\nStudents taking individual courses must meet admission requirements in order to be awarded the\ncredential.\n3. Policy Statement\n3.1 Registration\nA degree, diploma, or certificate program of study prescribes the number and types of courses required\nto complete the specific credential. Before registration, students are provided with all relevant Loyalist\nCollege policies and procedures. Students are expected to confirm, in writing, that they have received all\nrelevant policies and procedures.\nUpon payment of the prescribed tuition and non-tuition related feeds, a registered student is entitled to\nreceive instruction as to the maximum number of courses/credits as set out in the official program of\nstudy for each semester of the program.\nAdditional tuition feeds will be charged for each course beyond the established number of\ncourses/credits for the prescribed semester should a student wish to:\na) take one or more additional courses;\nb) repeat a course taken previously; or,\nc) take required foundation-level courses.\nPlacement and practicum courses will be charged at 40%.\nNote: When a student is over the course/credit limit for a semester, the student will be required to pay\nan additional fee. This requirement applies even if the student is repeating a course.\n"

        "text": "All new and returning students must complete the registration process by the deadline date set for each\nterm. Prior to the registration deadline, an invoice for fees will be forwarded to all students who are\neligible to register. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to ensure that these fees are paid or that\nsatisfactory arrangements are made for the payment of fees prior to the payment deadline.\n3.2 Full-Time Student Classification\nA student is considered to be a full-time student if they are officially enrolled in at least 70% of the\ncontact hours prescribed for the semester in the student\u2019s current program. Students with documented\naccommodations, who are registered with the AccessAbility Centre, are considered full-time students\nwhen they are registered in 40% of a full course load. A student wishing to exceed the normal course\nload must obtain program approval from the appropriate program coordinator and pay additional fees.\n3.3 Part-Time Student Classification\nA student who is registered in less than 70% of the contact hours prescribed for the program in the\ncurrent semester will be considered to be a part-time student. Additionally, a student who registers in\nmultiple post-secondary credit-level courses offered in the evening, weekend, or online offered by\nContinuing Education may be considered full-time if they are enrolled in 70% of a full-time course load in\na given semester as specified in the program of study. Enrolment Services will identify the status and\nnotify the student as to the adjustment.\n3.4 Course Change (Adds)\nA student must register (add) a course within the first 10 business days of the semester using the Course\nAdd/Drop & Program Change form. All special cases requesting entrance to a later date must be approved\nby the Registrar in consultation with the relevant Dean. In special circumstances, a student may be\npermitted to carry one or two evening or online credit courses while taking a partial day program.\nAll course additions to a student\u2019s timetable for a given term are to be completed by the end of the 10th\nday of classes from the beginning of the term as indicated in Loyalist\u2019s Academic Schedule. The request\nfor the addition of a course after the end of this period will be considered only in exceptional\ncircumstances and will require the approval of the Registrar in consultation with the relevant Dean.\n3.5 Course Change (Drop)\nA course must be dropped within the first 10 business days of the semester using the Course Add/Drop &\nProgram Change form with no record appearing on the student transcript.\nCourses dropped after the first 10 business days of the semester but before the last date to withdraw, as\nnoted on Loyalist\u2019s Academic Schedule, will be recorded with a \u201cW\u201d (withdrawn) on the student\u2019s\ntranscript.\n"

Final approval for course and program changes are the responsibility of the\nRegistrar. Where a student is sponsored by an external agency (e.g. Second Career, Workers\u2019\nCompensation Board, Community and Social Services, etc.) the proposed change must be supported by\nthe sponsoring agency before the action to transfer is taken.\n3.7 Course Pre-requisites, Co-requisites and Anti-requisites\nA student will not be permitted to enrol in a course for which they do not have the stated course pre-\nrequisite(s) and/or co-requisite(s) and or established equivalent(s).\nThe Ministry of Colleges and Universities (MCU)\u2019s Binding Policy Directive: Framework for Programs of\nInstruction, requires that all Ontario College diploma and advanced diploma programs include discrete\ngeneral education courses in their program of study. A student in a diploma or advanced diploma must\nattain three general education credits. These credits may consist of courses that have no pre- or co-\nrequisites attached to them, but there may be elective courses in which outcomes align significantly\nwith those offered in a required program of study. Courses are generally identified as anti-requisites\nwhen there is a very strong, documented overlap between the material studied in each course, and so\nthere would be little educational value in registering in both courses. Anti-requisites should only be\ndesignated when the course would not be a broadening experience for the student.\n3.8 Returning Students: Eligibility to Continue\nReturning students, who complete the registration process, are advised that such registration is\nconditional on their eligibility for continuation of study in the next term. A student who is required to\nwithdraw for academic or other reasons may not attend classes and the student\u2019s registration will be\nwithdrawn.\n3.9 Program Withdrawal\nA registered student, who has been attending classes, who wishes to formally withdraw from the\nCollege, must go to the Student Services Triage Desk for assistance with the process. Student Services\nwill forward appropriate paperwork to Enrolment Services for processing.\n"

Notifying\nthe course faculty or program coordinator does not constitute official withdrawal from a course or\nprogram. Failure to officially withdraw from a course or program will result in a failing grade in the\ncourse(s) which could impact a student\u2019s grade point averages and academic standing.\n4. Course/Program Fees and Refunds\nTuition and non-tuition fees for all programs are revised each year and are available from Enrolment\nServices. Fees paid for courses not taken in the term for which they were originally scheduled are not\ntransferable and may not be applied to subsequent semesters of study.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to monitor their account on the student information system and ensure\nthat all fees are paid. Delinquent accounts will be put on hold; future registration and access to grades\nwill be denied until payment is made.\n4.1 Refunds\n4.1.1 Full-Time Students\nDomestic students, who officially withdraw within 10 business days of program start-up, will receive a\nfull refund of fees, less a $150.00 administration fee, deferral fee(s) (if applicable) and additional program\ncosts (if applicable). After this time, fees are non-refundable. Students who have paid for two or more\nsemesters and withdraw after 10 business days of program start-up will receive a full refund of\nsubsequent semesters paid in advance. Students must formally inform the College that they are\nwithdrawing and complete the required forms through their Student Success Mentor.\nInternational students who have dropped courses or withdraw from the College within 10 business days\nof the beginning of a semester should refer to the International Student Fees section of the College\nwebsite.\nStudents, who have dropped a number of courses by the stated deadline, and as a result become part-\ntime in status, will qualify for a refund. Changing from full-time to part-time status may impact a\nstudent\u2019s eligibility for financial assistance (OSAP).\n"

Continuation of Study (Promotion and Progression)\nStudents must achieve and adhere to certain course and program criteria and requirements to progress\nand be promoted in their program of study.\n5.1 Promotion and Progression Requirements (Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Bachelor\u2019s\nDegrees and Graduate Certificate Programs)\nPromotion and progression requirements are that students must achieve a cumulative program grade\npoint average of 60% to be eligible to graduate from non-degree programs and 65% to graduate from\ndegree programs. Continuation of full-time study within a program is permitted provided the standards of\nacademic performance listed below are met. The minimum passing grade is 50% in each course unless\notherwise noted in the course documentation.\nNote: In addition to the above requirements, each academic program may have program-specific\nrequirements for passing grades, progression, probation, and withdrawal. It is the student\u2019s\nresponsibility to review the academic requirements for their specific program. Completion deadlines are\noutlined in AOP 224.\n5.2 Academic Standing\nA student, who has been required to withdraw for academic or misconduct reasons, will not be\nconsidered for re-admission to a program in a related discipline for a period of two consecutive\nsemesters/terms, as per AOP 224.\n5.3 Re-admission to a Program of Study\n"

Introduction and Purpose\u00a0\nApart from the academic research conducted by Loyalist College faculty, Loyalist participates in a number\nof surveys used to gather data from and about Loyalist\u2019s applicants, students, alumni, faculty, staff and\ncommunity. The increasing requirement \u2013 internally and externally \u2013 for gaining information about\nstakeholder experiences, and measuring outcomes, has resulted in an ongoing need for\nsurveys.\u00a0Analyzing survey results and trending, helps to inform future practices, therefore, it is essential\nthat survey results be reliable and meaningful. An increasing number of surveys has the potential to\nreduce their reliability if they repeatedly target audiences.

By\nensuring that solicitations match College priorities and donor interests, final results will maximize giving\nto the College. A series of uncoordinated solicitations to the same donor by different individuals in a\nsingle institution is one of the most undermining threats to successful fundraising efforts. A Prospect\nClearance Policy will help to alleviate this problem.\nPolicy Statement\nBefore any fundraising solicitation is initiated by any individual or group under the umbrella of Loyalist\nCollege (including staff, Foundation Directors, students, teams, alumni, etc\u2026), the prospect in question\nmust first be cleared through the College\u2019s Advancement Office and, by extension, the Executive\nCommittee of the College. This will ensure that input regarding institutional priorities, along with regional\npriorities, are coupled with expert advice to maximize fundraising success.\nGiven the fact that many requests for support made by student groups, alumni, etc., are relatively small\nin nature (e.g., requests for T-shirts, etc., for door prizes and things of that nature), requests for support\ntotaling less than $100 in value shall be exempt from this policy.\nThe only exception to the $100 exemption would be in any case where there is an expectation from the\ndonor that they receive a Charitable Tax Receipt. In any situation where the donor requests a receipt,\nregardless of the amount, clearance is subject to this process.\nmyLoyalist\n"

        "text": "4 \n1. Purpose \nLoyalist College (herein referred to as \u201cthe College\u201d) is a community of learners where \nrespectful living and learning is a cherished principle. For academic and other matters falling \noutside the scope of this Code, students should consult the list of policies posted on the \nCollege\u2019s website at: https://www.loyalistcollege.com/about-loyalist/policies/ and familiarize \nthemselves with the relevant academic calendar. The College uses operational policies and the \nStudent Code of Conduct to inform its students of its expectations for acceptable student \nconduct in academic and non-academic matters.  \nThe primary purpose of the Loyalist College Student Code of Conduct (hereafter referred to as \n\u201cthe Code\u201d or \u201cthis Code\u201d) is not to be punitive but, rather, to be a guideline for appropriate \nnon-academic behaviour across Loyalist College\u2019s diversified community. The Code provides a \nframework for review, investigation and resolution including sanctions, as appropriate. Where \npossible and appropriate, education and the provision of support services shall be used to \nattempt informal resolution of a matter before proceeding to formal resolution procedures. \nWhile this Code lays out specific avenues for Complaints and Appeals, the College encourages \nstudent to speak informally with the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, \nto better understand their options before proceeding with a complaint or response. \nThe administration of this Code and Loyalist College policies is to be conducted in a clear, fair, \nand timely manner with due regard for the principles of natural justice.  \n2. Oversight Responsibilities \nThe department of Student Life and Leadership administers the Student Code of Conduct in \nnon-academic matters. The Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, shall \nreview complaints, and respond according to the related procedures in this Code. \n \n3. Definitions \nAdvisor: A person selected by a Complainant or a Respondent to accompany them throughout \nthe process or a part of the process. The Advisor does not play an active role in any part of the \nprocesses under this Code except to act as a moral support for the party asking to be \naccompanied.  \nAppellant: The party who appeals a decision under this Code. \nComplainant: The party or parties initiating a complaint under this Code. \nCounter-Complaint: A complaint filed by a Respondent in response to the complaint alleging a \nbreach of the Student Code of Conduct by the original Complainant. \nDue Process: The principle that a party has a right to a fair and unbiased process that, amongst \nother things, incorporates the principles of the right to be heard or to know the case that has \nbeen made against a party to support any complaint or response. \n"

Such behaviour does not have to constitute a pattern but rather, harassment may \narise from a single instance of such behaviour.  \nInappropriate Behaviour: Refers to behaviours that compromise the positive learning and living \nenvironment at Loyalist College and which fall below the generally accepted standards outlined \nin this Code or in relevant municipal, provincial, and federal legislation. \nLoyalist College Community: Refers to students, alumni, staff, and visitors on Loyalist College \ncampuses and facilities; participants in College related programming (academic and non-\nacademic); and those involved in the use of College equipment or software. \nNatural Justice: For the purposes of this Code, natural justice means that a student: \n \na.   has the right to know the case against them; \na. has the right to present a defense; \nb. has a right to expect due process including the right to an unbiased complaint, \ninvestigation, and decision-making process; \nc. has the right to know reasons for a decision under this Code; and, \nd. has a right to appeal provided there are reasonable grounds for such appeal based \non a reasonable apprehension of bias or that another breach of natural justice has \ntaken place. \nOffence: Behaviour or actions by students that breach this Code or fall short of the College\u2019s \nstandard for student responsibilities. \nPenalties/Sanctions: Refers to measures taken to address breaches that fall below the \nexpected standards of behaviour. They are applied primarily to correct behaviour rather than to \npunish behaviour. \nReasonable Apprehension of Bias: A test to determine whether a decision has been unduly \ninfluenced by bias. \nRespondent: The party or parties responding to a complaint, or an appeal filed under this Code. \n"

The Code provides preventative guidance to members of the \nCollege community while also recognizing that breaches can occur from time to time and \nmust be dealt with accordingly. \n \n4.4 Risk Mitigation \nThe Code recognizes that occasionally, student behaviour may fall below generally accepted \nstandards.

NOTE: Not liking the result of a decision is not, \nin and of itself, grounds for appeal. Reasonable grounds would include evidence which, on \nits face, alleges bias or another fundamental breach of the principles of natural justice (e.g., \na failure to follow due process). \n5. Accommodation \nStudents with disabilities may require accommodation in relation to a hearing under this Code. \nIn such cases, the student is required to provide medical documentation to the Vice-President, \nStudent Life and Leadership, or Designate. With consent, the Vice-President, Student Life and \nLeadership, or Designate, will consult with the AccessAbility office to confirm and, as necessary, \nspecify the accommodations that should be provided when practicable to do so. \n6.

Students who violate an alcohol probation will \nbe placed on disciplinary probation automatically and future breaches of the Code may result in \nfurther sanctions being imposed. \n \nApology \u2013 Apologies are meant to express the remorse of the person offering an apology and \nto help repair any damage that has been done to the parties\u2019 relationship. Such apologies may \nbe private (i.e., party-to-party), or public (i.e., to the Loyalist community), as appropriate. \n \nBans \u2013 Students may be banned from one or more campus residences; from other areas on \ncampus; and/or from campus and campus-related facilities. Such a ban may have a formal \nTrespass to Property Notice attached which constitutes a legal notice and for which a breach \ncan lead to further legal sanctions.   \n \nBehaviour Contract \u2013 A behaviour contract is an agreement between an individual and the \nCollege, whereby an individual agrees to a set of specified behaviours, conditions, or \nexpectations. An individual may be issued a behaviour contract where it is determined to be \npart of the educative process for the individual and where the individual does not constitute an \nimmediate or enduring threat to other members of the Loyalist community. A behaviour \ncontract will often be issued together with a bond that will result in a fine being imposed \nshould the behaviour contract be breached. \n \nBond \u2013 A bond is a suspended fine and is used to ensure that an individual complies with a \nspecific behaviour contract, policy, or procedure and to ensure an appropriate level of \nbehaviour is maintained by the individual within the Loyalist community. If there are no \nbehaviour contract violations during the period specified in the bond, no fine will be issued. \nShould the behaviour contract be violated, the bond will be converted into a fine and charged \nto the student\u2019s account. NOTE: Additional sanctions may also apply. \n \nCommunity Service Hours \u2013 Community service provides a student with an opportunity to \nrepair any damage(s) or harm caused by their behaviour.

Completion of hours will be confirmed by the party supervising the requisite hours. \n \nEducational Assignment \u2013 These may be written or participative activities the purpose of which \nis to provide a student with increased knowledge as the impact of their behaviour on an \nindividual, the College community, or the community at large. They may be written, oral, \nparticipation in restorative justice processes, meeting with a College or external community \nmember with expertise in the issue, etc. \n \nExpulsion from Residence or the College \u2013 In some cases, the behaviour may be severe enough \nto warrant a student\u2019s expulsion from the College or from residence. In such cases, the student \nwill also be banned from campus or from residence and may be subject to a Trespass to \nProperty Notice. A decision to expel a student from the College will be made by the Vice-\nPresident, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, after consultation with the Senior Vice-\nPresident Academic. \n \nFines \u2013 A fine is a financial charge against a student\u2019s account in consequence of a breach of \nthis Code and to hold a student accountable for such breach. \n \nInterim Measures \u2013 In cases where the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or \nDesignate, deems it necessary, interim measures may be implemented. Such measures are \ntaken as the result of a reasonable belief in the need to protect the safety and well-being of the \nstudents involved in a complaint or for the protection of the larger Loyalist College community. \nSuch measures can include, but are not restricted to, room/residence re-location; temporary \nroom/residence/College ban; a No Contact/Communication Order; or other restrictions \ndeemed necessary while the complaints process is underway. Interim measures, similar to \nemergency measures, do not imply a finding of guilt. \n \nNo Communication Order \u2013 To safeguard the review and hearing process or to ensure a safe \nspace for students involved in a complaint, the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or \nDesignate, may issue a No Communication Order. Such an order restricts, as outlined in the \nOrder, communication between students involved in the complaint process until such time as \nthe matter has been resolved. \n \nNo Contact Order \u2013 To safeguard the review and hearing process or to ensure a safe space for \nstudents involved in a complaint, the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, \nmay issue a No Contact Order. Such an order restricts, as outlined in the Order, any form of \ncontact (which may also include matters covered under a No Communication Order) between \nstudents involved in the complaint process until such time as the matter has been resolved. \n \nNon-Academic Suspension \u2013 Students may be issued with a non-academic suspension which \nprohibits them from being on campus for any non-academic purpose. Except for classes, labs, \nassigned study groups, or other academic purpose, the suspended student is not permitted on-\ncampus and must leave immediately upon the academic purpose being completed.

Such \nprivileges may include participation in clubs, societies, or teams; eligibility for residence \nallocations or future residence allocations; or attendance at social functions on-campus or at \nCollege related events and activities. \n \nReferral \u2013 Students may, as directed by the relevant decision-maker, be required to attend \nmeetings/appointments with Designated people, organizations, or departments (on- or off-\ncampus) as an educative means to ensure fuller understanding or compliance to avoid future \nbreaches under this Code. \n \nRestitution \u2013 Relates to monetary sanctions directly meant to compensate for costs incurred \nfrom injury, loss, or other damages including, but not limited to, the cost of repair, \nreplacement, or other compensation. Restitution differs from Fines in that the assessment of \nthe amount of restitution is specifically related to those costs that are determined to be a direct \nconsequence of the inappropriate behaviour and the harm caused. \n \nViolence Threat Risk Assessment \u2013 In cases where there is a reasonable belief that a student \nmay pose a threat to the safety of others due to a high potential for physical harm to other \nmembers of the Loyalist community; high potential of damage to College property; or the \ncontinued presence of a student would be unduly disruptive, the Vice-President, Student Life \nand Leadership, or Designate, may seek an evaluation of the safety risk by referring the matter \nto an outside, third party, for further threat assessment.  In such cases, interim or emergency \nmeasures may be applied as the threat assessment is conducted. \n \nWritten Warning \u2013 A written warning is a low-level sanction that serves to warn a student that \na continuation of the behaviour outlined in the warning may result in further and more severe \nsanctions. \n \nNOTE: The College reserves the right to impose outcomes other than those outlined above \ndepending on the nature and severity of the behaviour or harm under review. \n \n \n \n10.

Any \nmember of the College community (the Complainant) may file a complaint under this Code, \nalleging a breach of the standards outlined in this Code. \n \nA. Filing a Complaint \n1. The complaint must be in writing with the Complainant\u2019s name and contact information. A \nresidence incident report or a security incident report may constitute a complaint. \nAnonymous complaints will not be reviewed for action. \n2. The complaint must be filed with the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership office \nwithin thirty calendar days of the alleged violation of the Code unless the Vice-President, \nStudent Life and Leadership, or Designate believes there are grounds for extending the \ndeadline. Reasons for extending the time limit may include, but are not limited to, pending \ncriminal proceedings; fear of/intimidation by the respondent(s); or an absence from the \nCollege by the Complainant. \n3. If it is determined by the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, that the \ncomplaint falls within the scope of the Code, the Vice-President will notify the parties (refer \nto Appendix B). \n4. If the complaint does not fall within the scope of the Code but may fall within the scope of \nanother College policy, the Complainant will be advised accordingly and provided with a \ncopy of the relevant policy and related procedures. A decision by the Vice-President, \nStudent Life and Leadership, or Designate, that a complaint does not fall within the scope of \nthe Code is final and not subject to appeal. \n5. If the complaint is determined to not fall within the jurisdiction of the Code or within the \njurisdiction of another College policy, the complaint will not proceed. In every case, the \nComplainant\u2019s right to seek redress outside the College is not extinguished by a decision the \ncomplaint does or does not fall within the scope of the Code. \n \nB. Responding To a Complaint \nThe following steps are to be followed when a formal complaint is received and determined to \nfall within the scope of the Code. \n1. Upon receipt of the complaint through conductcomplaints@loyalistcollege.com, the Vice-\nPresident, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, will contact the Complainant by either \nLoyalist College email, campus mail, or by Express Post to:  1) confirm the complaint has \nbeen received, and 2) schedule a meeting to review the complaint.  During the meeting, the \nVice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, will provide the Complainant \nwith more information on the complaint-resolution processes under the Code and identify \nsources of College support for the Complainant. \n"

        "text": "21 \nAPPENDIX C \u2013 INFORMAL RESOLUTION \nThe informal resolution process provides the Complainant(s) and Respondent(s) with the option \nof seeking a facilitated outcome to the complaint. It is meant to arrive at a common \nunderstanding of the harm done and to achieve a mutually agreeable outcome that is designed \nto repair or redress the harm/perceived harm. Any breakdown of the informal resolution \nprocess or any violation of the agreed upon terms will result in the matter being automatically \nreferred to the College\u2019s Student Code of Conduct Complaints Review Panel. \n \nA. Overview \n1. The Complainant may request an informal resolution process or the Vice-President, Student \nLife and Leadership, or Designate, may suggest it, and both parties (Complainant and \nRespondent) must both mutually agree to it. Where there is disagreement, or where the \nRespondent does not respond, the matter will proceed to the formal resolution process by \npresentation to the Student Code of Conduct Complaints Review Panel. \n2. Normally, the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, will facilitate the \ninformal resolution process. At their discretion, or at the request of both parties involved, \nanother College staff member, or members, may be called upon to facilitate. If the Vice-\nPresident, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, is not the facilitator, every effort will \nbe made to find a facilitator, or facilitators, who is/are mutually agreeable to the parties. \nFailure to find a mutually agreeable facilitator will result in the matter being referred to the \nStudent Code of Conduct Complaints Review Panel. \n3. At any point in the informal resolution process, either the Complainant or the Respondent \nmay choose to withdraw from the process, in which case the matter will be referred to the \nCollege\u2019s Student Code of Conduct Complaints Review Panel. \n4. At any point in the process, the Complainant or Respondent may elect to be accompanied \nby an Advisor. The Complainant or Respondent must provide the Vice-President, Student \nLife and Leadership, or Designate, or other facilitator(s) with the name/contact information \nof the Advisor, in writing, either through Loyalist College\u2019s email, campus mail, or Express \nPost, at least 24 hours prior to any scheduled meeting. \n5. The informal resolution process is confidential and personal information or admissions \nshared within the process may not be used by either party against the other in another \nresolution process. If the parties arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution, then the \nresolution/agreement may be shared with appropriate third parties or decision makers, but \nthe content of the process is to remain private and confidential. \n6. The facilitator(s) will work with the parties, separately or together, to achieve a commonly \nagreed upon outcome. The facilitator(s) may not act as a decision maker but can make \nsuggestions as per their role as facilitator. \n7. Any outcome must be determined jointly and entered voluntarily by the parties. \n8. Where a resolution is not reached, the case will be referred to the Student Code of Conduct \nComplaints Review Panel established under this Code. Likewise, if an agreement is reached \nbut not ultimately followed by either party, the matter will be referred to the Student Code \nof Conduct Complaints Review panel.

Once the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, has confirmed the \nComplainant wishes to resolve the matter informally, they will notify the Respondent of the \ncomplaint and the Complainant\u2019s desire to resolve the matter informally. The Vice-\nPresident, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, will invite the Respondent to meet in \nperson to discuss the nature of the complaint and the details of the Informal Resolution \nprocess: \ni. If the Respondent agrees to participate in the Informal Process, the process \nwill continue as outlined in paragraph 2 below. \nii. If the Respondent does not agree to participate, the matter will be referred \nto the Student Conduct Complaints Review Panel for formal resolution. \n2. After meeting with the Respondent to outline the nature of the complaint and the \nComplainant\u2019s desire to resolve the matter informally, the Vice-President, Student Life and \nLeadership, or Designate, or appointed facilitator(s), will meet with the Complainant, the \nRespondent, and any relevant witness(es), separately or jointly as required to facilitate the \nprocess.

These circumstances include, but are not limited to, those where there \nare reasonable grounds to believe the safety of others is endangered due to a high potential \nof physical harm; there is a potential of damage to College property; or the continued \npresence of the student would be unduly disruptive to individuals within the Loyalist \ncommunity or unduly disruptive to the Loyalist community overall. \n2. In such cases, the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, may invoke \nemergency measures by immediately imposing a range of restrictions, up to and including \ntemporary suspension from the College. In cases where a conflict-of-interest or a \nreasonable apprehension of bias may be perceived on the part of the Vice-President, or \nDesignate, the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate, shall refer the \nmatter to the Senior Vice-President Academic. \n3.

        "text": "40 \nAPPENDIX K \u2013 GUIDELINES FOR NATURAL JUSTICE \n1. The burden of proof in administrative hearings under this Code shall be on a balance of \nprobabilities which is informally interpreted as what is most likely to have happened. If \nthere is a belief that it is more likely than not that the incident occurred, the finding shall be \nthe complaint is upheld. If there is a belief that it is less likely that the incident occurred, the \nfinding shall be the complaint is denied. \n2. The process should proceed as quickly as possible providing each party\u2019s right to due \nprocess is not negatively affected. \n3. Each party must be given sufficient notice as outlined in this Code. \n4. The student(s) must be informed of the case against them and be given the opportunity to \nprepare a response. \n5. Both the Complainant and the Respondent have the right to be heard. \n6. Each party may have an Advisor present who, normally, will be a member of the College \ncommunity. An Advisor may be legal counsel outside the College. Advisors are there to \nsupport their respective party and shall have no active role (i.e., not be permitted to ask, or \nanswer questions during any hearing and shall be present in a support capacity only). \nStudents must inform the party conducting the hearing, in writing, including the contact \ndetails, and according to the timelines and format set out in this Code, if they plan to bring \nan Advisor. \n7. Complainant(s) and Respondent(s) may provide witnesses during proceedings, as \nappropriate. Students must inform the party conducting the hearing, in writing, including \nthe contact details, and according to the timelines and format set out in this Code, if they \nplan to bring a witness. Witnesses must normally appear but failure to appear does not stop \nthe proceeding from moving forward. It is the responsibility of the party calling the \nwitness(es) to ensure their witness(es) are notified of the time, date, and place of the \nmeeting. The Panel hearing the complaint may also compel witnesses to attend. In this \ninstance, it shall be the responsibility of the party hearing the complaint to ensure \nwitnesses are aware of the time, date, and location of the hearing. \n8. It is important to recognize procedures under this Code are administrative in nature and are \nnot meant to mimic a court of law. Consequently, rules of evidence or other laws that \nwould normally apply in a court of law may not apply, e.g., Rules regarding hearsay \nevidence. In hearings under this Code, hearsay evidence may be admitted provided the Sole \nDecision-Maker or Panel hearing the matter believes it is relevant and instructive to \ndetermining a fair and reasonable outcome for all parties. \n9. Evidence of past breaches, by either party to the before the relevant decision-maker, shall \nnot be raised unless directly relevant to the matter under review. \n10. At all levels, decisions must be made promptly and reasons for any decision are to be given \nin writing. \n"

        "text": "42 \nAPPENDIX L \u2013 RE-ENTRY PROCESS  \nThe establishment of a Re-Entry Plan is applicable to those students who have been suspended \nor expelled and are seeking readmission to the College. The Re-Entry Plan references a written \nagreement between the student and the College that specifies the required actions which must \nbe taken by the student in return for re-admission to the College. \nStudents seeking re-entry to the College following suspension or expulsion are required to \ncontact the Vice-President, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate. \nA meeting will be arranged between the student, the Vice-President, Student Life and \nLeadership, or Designate and the Director, Student Success (or Designate) to explore the \nstudent\u2019s circumstances and to determine whether the behaviours that led to the suspension \nor expulsion are now appropriately managed and no longer a source of concern. Consultation \nwill be undertaken as appropriate. Final Re-Entry Plans are to be approved by the Vice-\nPresident, Student Life and Leadership, or Designate. \nTo support the student\u2019s ability to manage his or her behaviour appropriately within the \nlearning environment, a behavioural contract may be issued which clearly outlines the \nexpectations for the student\u2019s behaviour and the potential consequences should the student \nbreach the terms of the behavioural contract. Behavioural contracts are reviewed and re-issued \nas required with the start of each subsequent semester the student attends. \n \n"
